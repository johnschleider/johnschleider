## Hello, I'm John Schleider.

I'm strongly interested in the intersection of economics, computer science, and data analytics. My past and current experiences include investment banking at Bank of America, a corporate banking internship at Wells Fargo, student analyst at the Williams Investment Society ($20 million AUM), and a degree in Economics (with honors) with minors in data science and computer science from Washington and Lee.
